# Julia scripts

My Julia scripts used for numerical computation. I like [chaotic systems][1] and [Sturm-Liouville problems][2] the most, so they are the main ones I solve in it.

To (hopefully) install all dependencies required for the scripts in this repository, and for turning Atom and VSCode into suitable IDEs run [all-deps.jl](all-deps.jl) in Julia.
