# Julia scripts

My Julia scripts used for numerical computation. I like chaotic systems and Sturm-Liouville problems the most, so they are the main ones I solve in it.

To (hopefully) install all dependencies required for the scripts in this repository, and for turning Atom and VSCode into suitable IDEs run [all-deps.jl](all-deps.jl) in Julia.
